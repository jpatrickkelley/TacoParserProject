# LoggingKata

An exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging

## Kata Overview

Here's what you'll need to do for this Kata:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Complete all the `TODO`s, while adding appropriate log statements along the way. You can find more details below in the Kata Details section:
    1. Start with writing a Unit Test to Test the Parse method
    2. Implement the Parse Method
    3. Use the [GeoCoordinate.NetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GeoCoordinate.NetCore/) NuGet package to calculate distance between two points
3. Reduce the logging verbosity and rerun

## Kata Details

Here's some more details for completing the steps above.

### TacoParser

Updating the `Parse` method in your `TacoParser`

This method is used to parse a single row from your CSV file as a string and return an ITrackable:

```csharp
public ITrackable Parse(string line)
{
    // Take your line and use line.Split(',') to split it up into an array of strings, separated by the char ','
    var cells = line.Split(',');

    // If your array.Length is less than 3, something went wrong
    if (cells.Length < 3)
    {
        // Log that and return null
    }

    // grab the latitude from your array at index 0
    // grab the longitude from your array at index 1
    // grab the name from your array at index 2

    // Your going to need to parse your string as a `double`
    // which is similar to parsing a string as an `int`

    // You'll need to create a TacoBell class
    // that conforms to ITrackable

    // Then, you'll need an instance of the TacoBell class
    // With the name and point set correctly

    // Then, return the instance of your TacoBell class
    // Since it conforms to ITrackable
}
```

### Program

You now have your `Parse` method working properly. Now, let's get into our Program file in our `Main` static method.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // DON'T FORGET TO LOG YOUR STEPS
    // Grab the path from the name of your file

    // use File.ReadAllLines(path) to grab all the lines from your csv file
    // Log and error if you get 0 lines and a warning if you get 1 line

    // Create a new instance of your TacoParser class
    // Grab an IEnumerable of locations using the Select command: var locations = lines.Select(parser.Parse);

    // Now, here's the new code

    // Create two `ITrackable` variables with initial values of `null`. These will be used to store your two taco bells that are the furthest from each other.
    // Create a `double` variable to store the distance

    // Include the Geolocation toolbox, so you can compare locations: `using GeoCoordinatePortable;`
    // Do a loop for your locations to grab each location as the origin (perhaps: `locA`)
    // Create a new corA Coordinate with your locA's lat and long

    // Now, do another loop on the locations with the scope of your first loop, so you can grab the "destination" location (perhaps: `locB`)
    // Create a new Coordinate with your locB's lat and long
    // Now, compare the two using `.GetDistanceTo()`, which returns a double
    // If the distance is greater than the currently saved distance, update the distance and the two `ITrackable` variables you set above

    // Once you've looped through everything, you've found the two Taco Bells furthest away from each other.
}
```
